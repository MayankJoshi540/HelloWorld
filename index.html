            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a rich
            diversity of ecosystems, climates, and species. Covered mostly by water, Earth has a dynamic atmosphere that
            sustains life through the water cycle and weather patterns. Its landmasses include continents and islands,
            while oceans regulate temperature and climate. Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days and rotates every
            24 hours, giving us day and night. With its protective magnetic field and ozone layer, Earth shields life
            from harmful solar radiation. It is our shared home, and preserving it is essential.

            <ol>
                <li><b>Only Known Planet with Life</b> – Earth supports a vast diversity of life due to its atmosphere,
                    water,
                    and suitable temperature.</li>
                <li><b>70% Water Surface</b> – About 70% of Earth’s surface is covered by oceans, making it unique among
                    known
                    planets.

                </li>
                <li><b>Protective Atmosphere </b>– Earth's atmosphere shields us from harmful radiation and helps
                    regulate the
                    planet's climate.
